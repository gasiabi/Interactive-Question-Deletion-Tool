# Study Question Manager

## Description
This Python script helps you manage a list of study questions interactively. It allows users to either continue from a previously saved session or restart with a new set of questions. You can review questions, delete them once answered, and save the remaining questions for later.

## Features
- **Start Over or Continue**: Choose to begin with a new question set or resume from your last session.
- **Interactive Session**: Randomly select questions, decide to delete or keep them.
- **Save Progress**: Remaining questions are saved in `save.txt` for the next session.

## Files
- **`questions.txt`**: Original list of questions (one question per line).
- **`save.txt`**: Stores the remaining questions after each session.
